## cloning
We are using git Hub
we can clone in three ways:https, SSH, GIThub CLI

Since we are using GitHub codespace, we'll create a temporary directory in our work space
```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp/new-project
git init
touch readme.md
code Readme.md
# make changes to readme.md
git commit -a -m "add readme file"
```

### HTTPS


```sh 
git clone: https://github.com/atulgosain/GithubExample.git
```
